                There are so many people in the world who never have the opportunity to pursue the
                career they love.I’m not one of them. I love what I do and since starting my career
                in Infosys , I’m thrilled to say that I’ve learned from so many trained professionals
                in my field. I know that I still have so much to learn from others in the industry.
               I’m a hard worker, a team player and excited to see what projects could benefit from my
               unique skill set.
